**Task Description**\
The task consisted of a same-different auditory melodic discrimination task. Participants were asked to detect whether the pitch of one of the tones had been changed in the second melody (S2; pitch change of two or three semitones). The change, when applied, preserved the melodic contour (the order of upward and downward pitch movement in a melody without regard to magnitude). The tones of the second melody were always reversed in time so that the final tone became the first. This transformation required a comparison between a sample and a transformed target. Therefore, participants had to manipulate auditory information in memory during the task. The changed tone in the reversed melodies could be that at any of the three possible positions.For each trial, participants listened binaurally to the first three-tone sequence over a duration of 750 ms (encoding, S1), followed by a silent retention period of 2000 ms and the second melodic sequence (retrieval, S2, 750-ms duration). As mentioned above, in the control condition, participants performed the auditory task without visual stimulation. During the rotating and random conditions, participants performed the same auditory task following 5-Hz visual stimulation with rotating or random Shepard’s objects (as in experiment 1), respectively. Visual stimulation lasted 4 s before the onset of the first auditory sequence.
